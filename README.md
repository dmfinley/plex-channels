=============

This repository contains the following plex channels:

NBA GameTime

NHL GameCenter Live

NHL Vault
This is for the archive viewing of NHL.com.  It doesn't support live games, but you can try to enable it if you want to.  I do not have the
live access, so cannot test it.  



A valid subscription is required to view the premium contents provided by these services.  

DISCLAIMER:

THESE CHANNELS ARE IN NO WAY SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE NHL AND/OR THE NBA.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
